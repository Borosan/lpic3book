# 332.1 Host Hardening

#### _Topic 332: Host Security_

**Weight:** 5

**Description:** Candidates should be able to secure computers running Linux against common threats.



**Key Knowledge Areas:**

* Configure BIOS and boot loader (GRUB 2) security
* Disable unused software and services
* Understand and drop unnecessary capabilities for specific systemd units and the entire system
* Understand and configure Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR), Data Execution Prevention (DEP) and Exec-Shield
* Black and white list USB devices attached to a computer using USBGuard
* Create an SSH CA, create SSH certificates for host and user keys using the CA and configure OpenSSH to use SSH certificates
* Work with chroot environments
* Use systemd units to limit the system calls and capabilities available to a process
* Use systemd units to start processes with limited or no access to specific files and devices
* Use systemd units to start processes with dedicated temporary and /dev directories and without network access
* Understand the implications of Linux Meltdown and Spectre mitigations and enable/disable the mitigations
* Awareness of polkit
* Awareness of the security advantages of virtualization and containerization

**The following is a partial list of the used files, terms and utilities:**

* grub.cfg
* systemctl
* getcap
* setcap
* capsh
* sysctl
* /etc/sysctl.conf
* /etc/usbguard/usbguard-daemon.conf

* usbguard
* ssh-keygen
* /etc/ssh/
* \~/.ssh/
* /etc/ssh/sshd\_config
* chroot



## Kernel Security

#### &#x20;Disabling unnecessary software:&#x20;

• Every running program presents a possible security threat.&#x20;

• Disabling unused services is a good security practice.&#x20;

• Use systemctl and chkconfig to disable services.&#x20;

• Commonly disabled services include atd, ava hi-daemon, cups.

#### &#x20;Limiting resource usage:&#x20;

• The user may limit system resources such as threads, open files, and memory.&#x20;

• The **paml\_limits.so** module allows operators to control how much of any one resource a user may access through hard and soft limits.

• Most systems come with pam.so preloaded.&#x20;

• The ulimit command may be used to adjust these limits at runtime.&#x20;

{% endhint %}

• Limits may be set persistently in /etc/security/limits.conf.&#x20;

#### Tuning kernel parameters:&#x20;

• The sysctl command is capable of displaying and setting kernel parameters.&#x20;

• Parameters map to the procfs filesystem.&#x20;

{% endhint %}

• Kernel parameters set persistently in the file /etc/sysctl.conf.&#x20;

> See kernel-docs for additional information.

#### Managing ASLR:&#x20;

• ASLR stands for Address Space Layout Randomization.&#x20;

• It ensures that every time a program loads, it loads into a different place in memory.

#### The NX bit:&#x20;

• The NX bit is a CPU feature.&#x20;

• It prevents execution from protected memory areas.&#x20;

• Exec-Shield is a software solution for the same problem designed to support CPUs without this feature.

#### ICMP security settings:

&#x20;• Network security may be enhanced through kernel parameter tuning.&#x20;

• Disabling ICMP is a common security measure that may be achieved by setting the parameter net.ipv4.icmp\_echo\_ignore\_all to 1.

#### Chroot Environments&#x20;

• A chroot environment is a ‘fake root’ that is set for a specific user and process.&#x20;

• The chroot command is used by root to create the environment using a pre-configured area in the filesystem.&#x20;

• An unprivileged process is unable to access files outside of a chroot environment.&#x20;

• Be mindful of hard links in chroot environments.they can get out!

#### Virtualization&#x20;

• Virtualization is similar to a chroot environment but at a much more advanced level.&#x20;

• Containerization is similar in nature when it comes to resource segmentation and process isolation.
