## Penetration test

A penetration test (pen test) is an authorized simulated attack performed on a computer system to evaluate its security. Penetration testers use the same tools, techniques, and processes as attackers to find and demonstrate the business impacts of weaknesses in a system. Penetration tests usually simulate a variety of attacks that could threaten a business. They can examine whether a system is robust enough to withstand attacks from authenticated and unauthenticated positions, as well as a range of system roles. With the right scope, a pen test can dive into any aspect of a system.

### &#x20;Phases of Penetration Testing

Pen testers simulate attacks by motivated adversaries. To do this, they typically follow a plan that includes the following steps:

* **Reconnaissance.** Gather as much information about the target as possible from public and private sources to inform the attack strategy. Sources include internet searches, domain registration information retrieval, social engineering, nonintrusive network scanning, and sometimes even dumpster diving. This information helps pen testers map out the target’s attack surface and possible vulnerabilities. Reconnaissance can vary with the scope and objectives of the pen test; it can be as simple as making a phone call to walk through the functionality of a system.
* **Scanning.** Pen testers use tools to examine the target website or system for weaknesses, including open services, application security issues, and open source vulnerabilities. Pen testers use a variety of tools based on what they find during reconnaissance and during the test.
* **Gaining access.** Attacker motivations can include stealing, changing, or deleting data; moving funds; or simply damaging a company’s reputation. To perform each test case, pen testers determine the best tools and techniques to gain access to the system, whether through a weakness such as SQL injection or through malware, social engineering, or something else.
* **Maintaining access.** Once pen testers gain access to the target, their simulated attack must stay connected long enough to accomplish their goals of exfiltrating data, modifying it, or abusing functionality. It’s about demonstrating the potential impact.
* **Covering tracks:** The attacker must clear any trace of compromising the victim system, any type of data gathered, log events, in order to remain anonymous.

### **The Benefits of Penetration Testing**

There are many benefits to performing penetration testing. Some of the key ones include:

* **Maintaining compliance.** Many organizations must undergo periodic penetration tests to comply with laws and regulations like the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS) and the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act .
* **Preventing cyberattacks.** One of the main benefits of penetration testing is finding vulnerabilities in systems. These problems can then be addressed before hackers exploit them.
* **Avoiding costly security incidents.** Penetration testing can help improve an organization’s security posture. Performing penetration tests helps organizations save money through making themselves less susceptible to attacks.
* **Keeping cybersecurity professionals up to date.** To be a successful penetration tester, it’s essential to keep up with the latest trends and techniques. Conducting regular penetration tests can also be beneficial for cybersecurity professionals because it requires them to stay current on the latest cyberthreats and defense measures.

### Popular Penetration Testing Tools

There are many different penetration testing tools available, and each has its strengths and weaknesses. Some of the most popular include:

* **Nmap.** Nmap is a powerful network scanning tool that can scan for open ports and services. It also includes features for identifying vulnerable applications.
* **Metasploit.** Metasploit is a vulnerability exploitation tool. It includes a library of exploits for a variety of programs and operating systems, as well as a wizard that can assist penetration testers in capitalizing on known vulnerabilities.
* **Wireshark.** Wireshark is a network analysis tool that can capture packet data from a network and decode it into readable form. This can be useful for identifying malicious traffic or sensitive information being transmitted over a network.
* **Burp Suite.** Burp Suite is an all-in-one web application security testing tool. It can scan websites for vulnerabilities, manipulate requests and responses, and intercept traffic between the client and server.

These are just a few of the many penetration testing tools available . As a penetration tester, it’s essential to be familiar with as many of them as possible so that you can choose the right tool for each penetration testing phase.





### nmap

**Nmap** is Linux command-line tool for network exploration and security auditing. This tool is generally used by hackers and cybersecurity enthusiasts and even by network and system administrators. It is used for the following purposes:&#x20;

* Real time information of a network
* Detailed information of all the IPs activated on your network
* Number of ports open in a network
* Provide the list of live hosts
* Port, OS and Host scanning

{% hint style="danger" %}
Before start scanning please note that Port scanning without authorization is sometimes against the provider's acceptable use policy (AUP).
