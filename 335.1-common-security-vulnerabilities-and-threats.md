This Lesson is more about concepts than configurations and commands, so lets get started.

### Viruses

A computer virus is a type of computer program that, when executed, replicates itself by modifying other computer programs and inserting its own code. If this replication succeeds, the affected areas are then said to be "infected" with a computer virus.

Computer viruses generally require a host program. The virus writes its own code into the host program. When the program runs, the written virus program is executed first, causing infection and damage

{% hint style="info" %}
&#x20;A [computer worm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer\_worm) does not need a host program, as it is an independent program or code chunk. Therefore, it is not restricted by the host program, but can run independently and actively carry out attacks.
{% endhint %}

### malware

**Malware**, short for **malicious software**, is any software intentionally designed to cause damage to a computer. Malware cause leak private information, gain unauthorized access to information or systems, deprive users access to information or which unknowingly interferes with the user's computer security and privacy.

#### What’s the difference between malware and a virus? <a href="#topic-1" id="topic-1"></a>

The terms “virus” and “malware” are often used interchangeably, but they’re not the same thing.&#x20;

**Malware** is an umbrella term for any **mal**icious soft**ware** written specifically to infect and harm the host system or its user. While a computer virus is a type of malware, not all malware are computer viruses.

The easiest way to differentiate computer viruses from other forms of malware is to think about viruses in biological terms. Take the flu virus, for example. The flu requires some kind of interaction between two people—like a hand shake,... .Once the flu virus gets inside a person’s system it attaches to healthy human cells, using those cells to create more viral cells.

A computer virus works in much the same way:

1. A computer virus requires a host program.
2. A computer virus requires user action to transmit from one system to another.
3. A computer virus attaches bits of its own malicious code to other files or replaces files outright with copies of itself.

It’s that second virus trait that tends to confuse people. Viruses can’t spread without some sort of action from a user, like opening up an infected Word document.&#x20;

Above malware and viruses is a larger, overarching category: threats.&#x20;

### threats

A computer threat is a term that relates to the security of a computer system being compromised. This threat can lead to cyber-attacks and data being stolen, lost or edited.

The threat could be caused by poor information security practices or a ‘backdoor’ in the code of the system.

## &#x20;other kinds of malware  <a href="#topic-4" id="topic-4"></a>

### **Worms**

A computer worm is an insidious type of malware designed to spread across multiple devices while remaining active on each.

The key difference between a computer worm and a virus is how a worm can spread copies of itself to uninfected machines completely on its own. For a workable computer worm definition, think of worms as self-sufficient malware able to execute and proliferate without user interaction. You don’t need to even be using your computer in order for a worm to activate, replicate, and spread. **Once a worm lands on your computer, it can start spreading immediately**.

Whereas viruses need to borrow your computer’s programming or code in order to execute and replicate themselves, worms are self-contained. That’s why there’s no such thing as a “worm virus” — they’re two completely different, though similar, types of malware.

### Rootkits

A rootkit is a **malicious software bundle designed to give unauthorized access to a computer or other software**. Rootkits are hard to detect and can conceal their presence within an infected system. Hackers use rootkit malware to remotely access your computer, manipulate it, and steal data.

When a rootkit takes hold, your system acts as if it were a zombie computer, and the hacker can **exert absolute control over your device using remote access**. This part of the rootkit definition is what makes them so powerful.

Similar to how fileless malware uses legitimate programs without leaving a trace, rookits may also appear to be legitimate, because the hacker has privileged access to system files and system processes. Rootkits make your computer lie to you, and sometimes, lie to antivirus and security software, too.

### trojans

Trojan horse malware is a file, program, or piece of code that **appears to be legitimate and safe, but is actually malware**. Trojans are packaged and delivered inside legitimate software (hence their name), and they’re often designed to spy on victims or steal data. Many Trojans also download additional malware after you install them.

<figure><img src=".gitbook/assets/viruses-malwares-trojans.jpg" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

> The Trojan gets its name from the **Trojan Horse** in the Greek epic poem _The Iliad._ In the story, the Greek hero Odysseus hatches a plan to construct a giant wooden horse that his enemies — the Trojans — would receive into their city as a gift. But within the belly of the horse hid a legion of soldiers, who emerged under cover of night to decimate the city of Troy from within.

Trojan malware works the same way — **it pretends to be something harmless, but it’s just a cover for its real, malicious intent**.

### keyloggers

Short for “keystroke logging,” a keylogger is a type of malicious software that **records every keystroke you make on your computer**. Keyloggers are a type of spyware — malware designed to spy on victims. Because they can capture everything you type, keyloggers are one of the most invasive forms of malware.

There are two main types of keyloggers: software and hardware. Keylogger software is more common than keylogger hardware, because the latter requires actual physical access to a device.

#### Keylogger software

Keylogger software is more common than keylogger hardware, because you don’t need physical access to a targeted device. Keylogger software works like other malicious software: it infiltrates your device through malicious links or attachments, or even exploits or Trojans. A keylogger runs silently in the background of your computer until you discover and remove it.

Keylogger software is usually malicious, but some companies and parents use it to keep tabs on employees and kids. Depending on their application, time-tracking software and parental monitoring apps can easily verge into spying territory. When keyloggers are used to spy on loved ones, they’re referred to as **stalkerware**.

#### Hardware-based keyloggers

Hardware-based keyloggers take the form of a physical device, like a USB stick or another item that may look similar to a charger. They record keystrokes and other data, to be retrieved later by a hacker. Hardware keyloggers are difficult to detect with antivirus software.

For a hacker to install a hardware-based keylogger, they must have **physical access to your device**. They’ll usually try to hide the hardware in the back of a desktop PC tower or somewhere else you’re unlikely to look.
