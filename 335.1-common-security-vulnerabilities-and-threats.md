# 335.1 Common Security Vulnerabilities and Threats

#### _Topic 335: Threats and Vulnerability Assessment_

**Weight:** 2

**Description:** Candidates should understand the principle of major types of security vulnerabilities and threats.



**Key Knowledge Areas:**

* Conceptual understanding of threats against individual nodes
* Conceptual understanding of threats against networks
* Conceptual understanding of threats against application
* Conceptual understanding of threats against credentials and confidentiality
* Conceptual understanding of honeypots

**The following is a partial list of the used files, terms and utilities:**

* Trojans
* Viruses
* Rootkits
* Keylogger
* DoS and DDoS
* Man in the Middle
* ARP and NDP forgery
* Rogue Access Points, Routers and DHCP servers
* Link layer address and IP address spoofing
* Buffer Overflows
* SQL and Code Injections
* Cross Site Scripting
* Cross Site Request Forgery
* Privilege escalation
* Brute Force Attacks
* Rainbow tables
* Phishing
* Social Engineering

This Lesson is more about concepts than configurations and commands, so lets get started.

### Viruses

A computer virus is a type of computer program that, when executed, replicates itself by modifying other computer programs and inserting its own code. If this replication succeeds, the affected areas are then said to be "infected" with a computer virus.

Computer viruses generally require a host program. The virus writes its own code into the host program. When the program runs, the written virus program is executed first, causing infection and damage

{% hint style="info" %}
&#x20;A [computer worm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer\_worm) does not need a host program, as it is an independent program or code chunk. Therefore, it is not restricted by the host program, but can run independently and actively carry out attacks.
{% endhint %}

### malware

**Malware**, short for **malicious software**, is any software intentionally designed to cause damage to a computer. Malware cause leak private information, gain unauthorized access to information or systems, deprive users access to information or which unknowingly interferes with the user's computer security and privacy.

#### What’s the difference between malware and a virus? <a href="#topic-1" id="topic-1"></a>

The terms “virus” and “malware” are often used interchangeably, but they’re not the same thing.&#x20;

**Malware** is an umbrella term for any **mal**icious soft**ware** written specifically to infect and harm the host system or its user. While a computer virus is a type of malware, not all malware are computer viruses.

The easiest way to differentiate computer viruses from other forms of malware is to think about viruses in biological terms. Take the flu virus, for example. The flu requires some kind of interaction between two people—like a hand shake,... .Once the flu virus gets inside a person’s system it attaches to healthy human cells, using those cells to create more viral cells.

A computer virus works in much the same way:

1. A computer virus requires a host program.
2. A computer virus requires user action to transmit from one system to another.
3. A computer virus attaches bits of its own malicious code to other files or replaces files outright with copies of itself.

It’s that second virus trait that tends to confuse people. Viruses can’t spread without some sort of action from a user, like opening up an infected Word document.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
**Worms**

A **computer worm** is a standalone malware computer program that replicates itself in order to spread to other computers. It often uses a computer network to spread itself, relying on security failures on the target computer to access it. It will use this machine as a host to scan and infect other computers. When these new worm-invaded computers are controlled, the worm will continue to scan and infect other computers using these computers as hosts, and this behavior will continue.&#x20;

Computer worms use recursive methods to copy themselves without host programs and distribute themselves based on the law of exponential growth, thus controlling and infecting more and more computers in a short time. Worms almost always cause at least some harm to the network, even if only by consuming bandwidth, whereas viruses almost always corrupt or modify files on a targeted computer.
{% endhint %}

Above malware and viruses is a larger, overarching category: threats.&#x20;

### threats

A computer threat is a term that relates to the security of a computer system being compromised. This threat can lead to cyber-attacks and data being stolen, lost or edited.

The threat could be caused by poor information security practices or a ‘backdoor’ in the code of the system.
