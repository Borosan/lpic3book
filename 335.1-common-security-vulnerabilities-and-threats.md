# 335.1 Common Security Vulnerabilities and Threats

#### _Topic 335: Threats and Vulnerability Assessment_

**Weight:** 2

**Description:** Candidates should understand the principle of major types of security vulnerabilities and threats.



**Key Knowledge Areas:**

* Conceptual understanding of threats against individual nodes
* Conceptual understanding of threats against networks
* Conceptual understanding of threats against application
* Conceptual understanding of threats against credentials and confidentiality
* Conceptual understanding of honeypots

**The following is a partial list of the used files, terms and utilities:**

* Trojans
* Viruses
* Rootkits
* Keylogger
* DoS and DDoS
* Man in the Middle
* ARP and NDP forgery
* Rogue Access Points, Routers and DHCP servers
* Link layer address and IP address spoofing
* Buffer Overflows
* SQL and Code Injections
* Cross Site Scripting
* Cross Site Request Forgery
* Privilege escalation
* Brute Force Attacks
* Rainbow tables
* Phishing
* Social Engineering

This Lesson is more about concepts than configurations and commands, so lets get started.

### Viruses

A computer virus is a type of computer program that, when executed, replicates itself by modifying other computer programs and inserting its own code. If this replication succeeds, the affected areas are then said to be "infected" with a computer virus.

Computer viruses generally require a host program. The virus writes its own code into the host program. When the program runs, the written virus program is executed first, causing infection and damage

{% hint style="info" %}
&#x20;A [computer worm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer\_worm) does not need a host program, as it is an independent program or code chunk. Therefore, it is not restricted by the host program, but can run independently and actively carry out attacks.
{% endhint %}

### malware

**Malware**, short for **malicious software**, is any software intentionally designed to cause damage to a computer. Malware cause leak private information, gain unauthorized access to information or systems, deprive users access to information or which unknowingly interferes with the user's computer security and privacy.

#### What’s the difference between malware and a virus? <a href="#topic-1" id="topic-1"></a>

The terms “virus” and “malware” are often used interchangeably, but they’re not the same thing.&#x20;

**Malware** is an umbrella term for any **mal**icious soft**ware** written specifically to infect and harm the host system or its user. While a computer virus is a type of malware, not all malware are computer viruses.

The easiest way to differentiate computer viruses from other forms of malware is to think about viruses in biological terms. Take the flu virus, for example. The flu requires some kind of interaction between two people—like a hand shake,... .Once the flu virus gets inside a person’s system it attaches to healthy human cells, using those cells to create more viral cells.

A computer virus works in much the same way:

1. A computer virus requires a host program.
2. A computer virus requires user action to transmit from one system to another.
3. A computer virus attaches bits of its own malicious code to other files or replaces files outright with copies of itself.

It’s that second virus trait that tends to confuse people. Viruses can’t spread without some sort of action from a user, like opening up an infected Word document.&#x20;

Above malware and viruses is a larger, overarching category: threats.&#x20;

### threats

A computer threat is a term that relates to the security of a computer system being compromised. This threat can lead to cyber-attacks and data being stolen, lost or edited.

The threat could be caused by poor information security practices or a ‘backdoor’ in the code of the system.

## &#x20;other kinds of malware  <a href="#topic-4" id="topic-4"></a>

### **Worms**

A computer worm is an insidious type of malware designed to spread across multiple devices while remaining active on each.

The key difference between a computer worm and a virus is how a worm can spread copies of itself to uninfected machines completely on its own. For a workable computer worm definition, think of worms as self-sufficient malware able to execute and proliferate without user interaction. You don’t need to even be using your computer in order for a worm to activate, replicate, and spread. **Once a worm lands on your computer, it can start spreading immediately**.

Whereas viruses need to borrow your computer’s programming or code in order to execute and replicate themselves, worms are self-contained. That’s why there’s no such thing as a “worm virus” — they’re two completely different, though similar, types of malware.

### Rootkits

A rootkit is a **malicious software bundle designed to give unauthorized access to a computer or other software**. Rootkits are hard to detect and can conceal their presence within an infected system. Hackers use rootkit malware to remotely access your computer, manipulate it, and steal data.

When a rootkit takes hold, your system acts as if it were a zombie computer, and the hacker can **exert absolute control over your device using remote access**. This part of the rootkit definition is what makes them so powerful.

Similar to how fileless malware uses legitimate programs without leaving a trace, rookits may also appear to be legitimate, because the hacker has privileged access to system files and system processes. Rootkits make your computer lie to you, and sometimes, lie to antivirus and security software, too.
