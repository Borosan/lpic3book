## Linux Login basics

### /etc/login.defs

The **/etc/login.defs** file provides default configuration information for several user account parameters. The useradd, usermod, userdel, and groupadd commands, and other user and group utilities take default values from this file. Each line consists of a directive name and associated value.

```
[root@rocky8 ~]# cat /etc/login.defs
#
# Please note that the parameters in this configuration file control the
# behavior of the tools from the shadow-utils component. None of these
# tools uses the PAM mechanism, and the utilities that use PAM (such as the
# passwd command) should therefore be configured elsewhere. Refer to
# /etc/pam.d/system-auth for more information.
#

# *REQUIRED*
#   Directory where mailboxes reside, _or_ name of file, relative to the
#   home directory.  If you _do_ define both, MAIL_DIR takes precedence.
#   QMAIL_DIR is for Qmail
#
#QMAIL_DIR      Maildir
MAIL_DIR        /var/spool/mail
#MAIL_FILE      .mail

# Default initial "umask" value used by login(1) on non-PAM enabled systems.
# Default "umask" value for pam_umask(8) on PAM enabled systems.
# UMASK is also used by useradd(8) and newusers(8) to set the mode for new
# home directories if HOME_MODE is not set.
# 022 is the default value, but 027, or even 077, could be considered
# for increased privacy. There is no One True Answer here: each sysadmin
# must make up their mind.
UMASK           022

# HOME_MODE is used by useradd(8) and newusers(8) to set the mode for new
# home directories.
# If HOME_MODE is not set, the value of UMASK is used to create the mode.
HOME_MODE       0700

# Password aging controls:
#
#       PASS_MAX_DAYS   Maximum number of days a password may be used.
#       PASS_MIN_DAYS   Minimum number of days allowed between password changes.
#       PASS_MIN_LEN    Minimum acceptable password length.
#       PASS_WARN_AGE   Number of days warning given before a password expires.
#
PASS_MAX_DAYS   99999
PASS_MIN_DAYS   0
PASS_MIN_LEN    5
PASS_WARN_AGE   7

#
# Min/max values for automatic uid selection in useradd
#
UID_MIN                  1000
UID_MAX                 60000
# System accounts
SYS_UID_MIN               201
SYS_UID_MAX               999

#
# Min/max values for automatic gid selection in groupadd
#
GID_MIN                  1000
GID_MAX                 60000
# System accounts
SYS_GID_MIN               201
SYS_GID_MAX               999

#
# If defined, this command is run when removing a user.
# It should remove any at/cron/print jobs etc. owned by
# the user to be removed (passed as the first argument).
#
#USERDEL_CMD    /usr/sbin/userdel_local

#
# If useradd should create home directories for users by default
# On RH systems, we do. This option is overridden with the -m flag on
# useradd command line.
#
CREATE_HOME     yes

# This enables userdel to remove user groups if no members exist.
#
USERGROUPS_ENAB yes

# Use SHA512 to encrypt password.
ENCRYPT_METHOD SHA512
```

/etc/login.defs has been replaced with pam over the time but some of parameters are still here:

* Location of user mailboxes **MAIL\_DIR**
* Password aging controls
* Minimum and maximum values for automatic **UID** selection (1000 to 60000)
* Minimum and maximum values for automatic **GID** selection (1000 to 60000)
* Whether home directories should be created when adding a new user
* Default **umask**
* Encryption method used to encrypt passwords

{% hint style="danger" %}
The /etc/login.defs file defines the configuration of the shadow password suite.(hidden passwords) for the system. This file is essential. His absence will not prevent the system to work, but will probably have undesirable consequences.
{% endhint %}

### chage

&#x20;the “chage” command is derived from the words **“Change Age”**, which is used to modify the information such as duration when to change password, make account status active or inactive, sets expiry date of the account, and sets a reminder to change the password through an alarm before user’s account will be inactive.

* note1: chage requires root for most functionality.
* note2: User must have entry in /etc/shadow (it must be a local user, it can't be stored in sssd or user in Remote Directory Server)

```
[root@rocky8 ~]# chage -h
Usage: chage [options] LOGIN

Options:
  -d, --lastday LAST_DAY        set date of last password change to LAST_DAY
  -E, --expiredate EXPIRE_DATE  set account expiration date to EXPIRE_DATE
  -h, --help                    display this help message and exit
  -I, --inactive INACTIVE       set password inactive after expiration
                                to INACTIVE
  -l, --list                    show account aging information
  -m, --mindays MIN_DAYS        set minimum number of days before password
                                change to MIN_DAYS
  -M, --maxdays MAX_DAYS        set maximum number of days before password
                                change to MAX_DAYS
  -R, --root CHROOT_DIR         directory to chroot into
  -W, --warndays WARN_DAYS      set expiration warning days to WARN_DAYS
```

{% hint style="info" %}
A value of -1 may be used to inactive many options.
{% endhint %}

### NSS Concepts

NSS stands for Name Service Switch. It connects calls for information from a system data base to a back-end service.

#### /etc/nsswitch.conf

**/etc/nsswitch.conf** is a Linux configuration file that specifies how the system should switch between different name service providers. The file can be used to configure which services should be used for hostname lookup, password lookups, and so on.

“/etc/nsswitch.conf” file is read by the **Name Service Switch (NSS)** library when the system starts up. The NSS library then uses the information in “/etc/nsswitch.conf” to determine which name service providers should be used for each type of lookup.

```
[root@rocky8 ~]# cat /etc/nsswitch.conf
#
# /etc/nsswitch.conf
#
# Name Service Switch config file. This file should be
# sorted with the most-used services at the beginning.
#
# Valid databases are: aliases, ethers, group, gshadow, hosts,
# initgroups, netgroup, networks, passwd, protocols, publickey,
# rpc, services, and shadow.
#
# Valid service provider entries include (in alphabetical order):
#
#       compat                  Use /etc files plus *_compat pseudo-db
#       db                      Use the pre-processed /var/db files
#       dns                     Use DNS (Domain Name Service)
#       files                   Use the local files in /etc
#       hesiod                  Use Hesiod (DNS) for user lookups
#       nis                     Use NIS (NIS version 2), also called YP
#       nisplus                 Use NIS+ (NIS version 3)
#
# See `info libc 'NSS Basics'` for more information.
#
# Commonly used alternative service providers (may need installation):
#
#       ldap                    Use LDAP directory server
#       myhostname              Use systemd host names
#       mymachines              Use systemd machine names
#       mdns*, mdns*_minimal    Use Avahi mDNS/DNS-SD
#       resolve                 Use systemd resolved resolver
#       sss                     Use System Security Services Daemon (sssd)
#       systemd                 Use systemd for dynamic user option
#       winbind                 Use Samba winbind support
#       wins                    Use Samba wins support
#       wrapper                 Use wrapper module for testing
#
# Notes:
#
# 'sssd' performs its own 'files'-based caching, so it should generally
# come before 'files'.
#
# WARNING: Running nscd with a secondary caching service like sssd may
#          lead to unexpected behaviour, especially with how long
#          entries are cached.
#
# Installation instructions:
#
# To use 'db', install the appropriate package(s) (provide 'makedb' and
# libnss_db.so.*), and place the 'db' in front of 'files' for entries
# you want to be looked up first in the databases, like this:
#
# passwd:    db files
# shadow:    db files
# group:     db files

# In order of likelihood of use to accelerate lookup.
passwd:      sss files systemd
shadow:     files sss
group:       sss files systemd
hosts:      files dns myhostname
services:   files sss
netgroup:   sss
automount:  files sss

aliases:    files
ethers:     files
gshadow:    files
# Allow initgroups to default to the setting for group.
# initgroups: files
networks:   files dns
protocols:  files
publickey:  files
rpc:        files
```

{% hint style="danger" %}
“/etc/nsswitch.conf” is a critical part of the Linux operating system, and any changes to the file can potentially cause serious problems.
{% endhint %}

## pam concepts and configuration

PAM (pluggable authentication module) has become a core part of login in most modern linux distributions. PAM is made up number of modules each handling unique function regarding  authentication and authorization. Applications enabled to make use of PAM can be _plugged-in_ to new technologies without modifying the existing applications.

&#x20;PAM is divided to four management groups:

* **account**: provide services for account verification: has the user’s password expired?; is this user permitted access to the requested service?.
* **authentication**: authenticate a user and set up user credentials.
* **password**: are responsible for updating user passwords and work together with authentication modules.
* **session**: manage actions performed at the beginning of a session and end of a session.

The PAM framework consists of a library, pluggable modules, and a configuration file.

* The **PAM library** implements the PAM application programming interface (API) and serves to manage PAM transactions and invoke the PAM service programming interface (SPI) defined in the pluggable modules.
* **Pluggable modules** are dynamically loaded by the library based on the invoking service and its entry in the configuration file. Success is determined not only by the pluggable module but also by the behavior defined for the service. Through the concept of _stacking_, a service can be configured to authenticate through multiple authentication methods. If supported, modules can also be configured to use a previously submitted password rather than prompting for additional input.
* **configuration file** In earlier versions of PAM, the /etc/pam.conf file was used, but this file is now deprecated and is only used if the /etc/pam.d/ directory does not exist

#### How PAM Works

The functionality of the PAM system is actually fairly basic. Any service that requires authentication is linked against the PAM libraries included with Linux.

&#x20;For example, try the following:

```
[root@rocky8 ~]# ldd /bin/login
        linux-vdso.so.1 (0x00007fffef899000)
        libpam.so.0 => /lib64/libpam.so.0 (0x00007ff685477000)
        libpam_misc.so.0 => /lib64/libpam_misc.so.0 (0x00007ff685273000)
        libaudit.so.1 => /lib64/libaudit.so.1 (0x00007ff685049000)
        libselinux.so.1 => /lib64/libselinux.so.1 (0x00007ff684e1f000)
        libc.so.6 => /lib64/libc.so.6 (0x00007ff684a5a000)
        libdl.so.2 => /lib64/libdl.so.2 (0x00007ff684856000)
        libcap-ng.so.0 => /lib64/libcap-ng.so.0 (0x00007ff684650000)
        libpthread.so.0 => /lib64/libpthread.so.0 (0x00007ff684430000)
        libpcre2-8.so.0 => /lib64/libpcre2-8.so.0 (0x00007ff6841ac000)
        /lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2 (0x00007ff685891000)
```

When a specific service such as login requires user authentication, it employs the PAM routines to complete this authentication. These routines look at the PAM configuration files for stack entries with a matching service name. They then process these entries in the order in which they are found, one by one.

#### /etc/pam.d

The /etc/pam.d/ directory contains the PAM configuration files for each PAM-aware application.

```
